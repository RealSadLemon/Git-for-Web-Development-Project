## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? - Git is a Version Control System.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? - Git is the program that operates the remote repositories, GitHub is a UI that allows you to manipulate git using clickable tools.
3. Why do we create a branch? - <git branch "branch-name">
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? - To merge the remote repository with your local repository and ensure your version is the most up to whatever branch you're changing.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. - <git checkout -b "FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME">
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? - git fetch lets you use items from another repository and keep them there, whereas git merge exists to try and put two repositories together, and git pull brings the data from a repository to another. 
7. What is a merge conflict? - something that happens when git can't auto-resolve differences in code between two commits to a repository.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? - first manually editing conflicted files, then you would try committing to both branches again before attempting another merge.
